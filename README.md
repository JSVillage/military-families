## Veteran Services Project ##

The United States currently has a Mental Health Crisis on it's hand with large numbers of U.S Veterans returning home not just with scars and missing limbs, but with trauma and a damaged soul. A 2016 VA report shows that an average of 20 veterans per day commit suicide. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that there are 57,849 veterans that are homeless on any given night. Many of these soldiers are returning Vets from serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. Society must take action against this crisis.
